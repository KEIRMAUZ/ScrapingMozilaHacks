"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2024/06/snapshots-for-ipc-fuzzing/","Snapshots for IPC Fuzzing","By Christian Holler","By running potentially harmful code with lower privileges, the impact of a potential code execution vulnerability is mitigated. In order to gain full control, the attacker now needs to find a second vulnerability that allows bypassing these privilege restrictions – which is colloquially known as a “sandbox escape”.",

"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2024/04/prototype-even-faster-with-the-gradio-ui-for-figma-component-library/","Prototype even faster with the Gradio UI for Figma component library","By Thomas Lodato, Dan Brown","Although Gradio has made the development phase of prototyping easier, the design phase has been largely the same. Even with Gradio, designers have had to create components in Figma, outline expected user flows and behaviors, and hand off designs for developers in the same way they have always done. While working on a recent exploration, we realized something was needed: a set of Figma components based on Gradio that enabled designers to create wireframes quickly.",
"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2024/03/improving-performance-in-firefox-and-across-the-web-with-speedometer-3/","Improving Performance in Firefox and Across the Web with Speedometer 3","By Brian Grinstead","This fulfills the vision set out in December 2022 to bring experts across the industry together in order to rethink how we measure browser performance, guided by a shared goal to reflect the real-world Web as much as possible. This is the first time the Speedometer benchmark, or any major browser benchmark, has been developed through a cross-industry collaboration supported by each major browser engine: Blink, Gecko, and WebKit. Working together means we can build a shared understanding of what matters to optimize, and facilitates broad review of the benchmark itself: both of which make it a stronger lever for improving the Web as a whole.",
"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2024/02/announcing-interop-2024/","Announcing Interop 2024","By James Graham","The web platform is built on interoperability based on common standards. This offers users a degree of choice and control that sets the web apart from proprietary platforms defined by a single implementation. A commitment to ensuring that the web remains open and interoperable forms a fundamental part of Mozilla’s manifesto and web vision, and is why we’re so committed to shipping Firefox with our own Gecko engine.",

Our goal is to build performance tests that simulate real-world user experiences so that browsers have better tools to drive improvements for real users on real webpages. While it’s easy to see that benchmarks have improved in Firefox throughout the year as a result of this work, what we really care about is how much those wins are being felt by our users.",
